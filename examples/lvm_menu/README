This is an example of bash tool to build a customized LVM management menu.

First, make sure to make menu.bash and lvm_menu.bash executable:
(chmod +x menu.bash lvm_menu.bash).

menu.bash     is used to create a generic menu with smenu
lvm_menu.bash uses menu.bash to create a specialized menu to manage LVM objects

Running lvm_menu.bash -i should display something similar to the screenshot
provided. In this screenshot the user is about to delete a LV.
